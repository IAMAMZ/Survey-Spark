        <h1>{ About Us }</h1>
        <p>Every great journey begins with a story. Ours started when a group of passionate data enthusiasts came together with a shared vision: to revolutionize how businesses collect and interpret insights. We believe that every data point tells a story, and we’re here to help you uncover those narratives.</p>
        <p>Our purpose is crystal clear: <strong>empowering informed decisions.</strong> We understand that data isn’t just numbers; it’s the heartbeat of your organization. Whether you’re a startup, a nonprofit, or an enterprise, we’re committed to providing you with actionable intelligence.</p>
        <p>Remember, at SurveySpark, we’re not just about surveys; we’re about illuminating possibilities. Explore our services, meet our team, and let’s make some surveys!</p>
